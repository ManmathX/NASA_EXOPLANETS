Our solution-Imagine trying to find tiny planets far away by looking at huge amounts of star brightness data collected by different space telescopes. Now, it’s impossible for one person or even one AI to handle all this data perfectly.

So, the idea is to have many AI “helpers,” each one looking at the data from its own space telescope. They don’t share the raw data because it might be too big or private, but they share what they learn. This way, they combine their knowledge and get smarter together.

But here’s the cool part—these AI helpers don’t just say “planet found” or “no planet.” They also show you why they think a planet is there, like pointing out the exact tiny dip in the star’s light. This helps scientists (and even beginners) understand what the AI is seeing and trust its decisions.

Then, humans jump in to check the AI’s work. They confirm if it really looks like a planet or if it’s a false alarm. This feedback is given back to the AI so it can learn and avoid the same mistakes next time.

So basically, it’s a team effort where smart AI and people work together, helping each other to find new planets better and faster. Plus, you don’t have to be a NASA scientist to be part of it—anyone curious can join in, learn, and contribute!

This way, we make planet hunting easier, fairer, and more fun for everyone.

Business Model and Ecosystem Development
To sustain and expand this collaborative discovery model, a viable business and
operational framework is essential. Possible models include:
• Open Science Platforms (Open source for space enthusists): Free public access
supported by grants and institutional funding, encouraging citizen participation
and fostering STEM education.
• Commercial Partnerships: Collaborations with private space companies and data
analytics firms to enhance AI tools for both scientific and commercial
applications (e.g., satellite missions).
• Subscription and API Services: Data analytics as a service for academic
institutions, researchers, and hobbyists seeking advanced exoplanet datasets and
AI tools.
• Education and Outreach: Licensing technology to educational platforms and
museums to encourage experiential learning and public engagement.
This multifaceted approach ensures continuous innovation, broad community
involvement, and sustainable funding to drive exoplanet research forward.
